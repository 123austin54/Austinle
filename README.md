JavaWordle:
Contains java code to give me a list of 6 letter names I could use in my word bank.
I used those for the wordle like game instead of a list of words.

WordleBuild:
Contains the actual wordle like game - "austinle". I did this project for fun and to learn.
My code is heavily inspired by Morgenstern2573 on github and this article https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-wordle-clone-in-javascript/
by Paul Akinyemi. I hope you enjoy my narcissistic twist!!
